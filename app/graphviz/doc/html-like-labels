ALIGN

specifies horizontal placement. When an object is allocated more space than required, this value determines where the extra space is placed left and right of the object.
CENTER aligns the object in the center. (Default)
LEFT aligns the object on the left.
RIGHT aligns the object on the right.
(<TD> only) TEXT aligns lines of text using the full cell width. The alignment of a line is determined by its (possibly implicit) associated <BR> element.
The contents of a cell are normally aligned as a block. In particular, lines of text are first aligned as a text block based on the width of the widest line and the corresponding <BR> elements. Then, the entire text block is aligned within a cell. If, however, the cell's ALIGN value is "TEXT", and the cell contains lines of text, then the lines are justified using the entire available width of the cell. If the cell does not contain text, then the contained image or table is centered.

BALIGN
specifies the default alignment of <BR> elements contained in the cell. That is, if a <BR> element has no explicit ALIGN attribute, the attribute value is specified by the value of BALIGN.
BGCOLOR="color"
sets the color of the background. This color can be overridden by a BGCOLOR attribute in descendents. The value can be a single color or two colors separated by a colon, the latter indicating a gradient fill.
BORDER="value"
specifies the width of the border around the object in points. A value of zero indicates no border. The default is 1. The maximum value is 255. If set in a table, and CELLBORDER is not set, this value is also used for all cells in the table. It can be overridden by a BORDER tag in a cell.
CELLBORDER="value"
specifies the width of the border for all cells in a table. It can be overridden by a BORDER tag in a cell. The maximum value is 255.
CELLPADDING="value"
specifies the space, in points, between a cell's border and its content. The default is 2. The maximum value is 255.
CELLSPACING="value"
specifies the space, in points, between cells in a table and between a cell and the table's border. The default is 2. The maximum value is 127.
COLOR="color"
sets the color of the font within the scope of <FONT>...</FONT>, or the border color of the table or cell within the scope of <TABLE>...</TABLE>, or <TD>...</TD>. This color can be overridden by a COLOR attribute in descendents. By default, the font color is determined by the fontcolor attribute of the corresponding node, edge or graph, and the border color is determined by the color attribute of the corresponding node, edge or graph.
COLSPAN="value"
specifies the number of columns spanned by the cell. The default is 1. The maximum value is 65535.
COLUMNS="value"
provides general formatting information concerning the columns. At present, the only legal value is "*", which causes a vertical rule to appear between every cell in every row.
FACE="fontname"
specifies the font to use within the scope of <FONT>...</FONT>. This can be overridden by a FACE attribute in descendents. By default, the font name is determined by the fontname attribute of the corresponding node, edge or graph.
FIXEDSIZE
specifies whether the values given by the WIDTH and HEIGHT attributes are enforced.
FALSE allows the object to grow so that all its contents will fit. (Default)
TRUE fixes the object size to its given WIDTH and HEIGHT. Both of these attributes must be supplied.
GRADIENTANGLE="value"
gives the angle used in a gradient fill if the BGCOLOR is a color list. For the default linear gradient, this specifies the angle of a line through the center along which the colors transform. Thus, an angle of 0 will cause a left-to-right progression. For radial gradients (see STYLE), the angle specifies the position of the center of the coloring. An angle of 0 places the center at the center of the table or cell; an non-zero angle places the fill center along that angle near the boundary.
HEIGHT="value"
specifies the mininum height, in points, of the object. The height includes the contents, any spacing and the border. Unless FIXEDSIZE is true, the height will be expanded to allow the contents to fit. The maximum value is 65535.
HREF="value"
attaches a URL to the object. Note that the "value" is treated as an escString similarly to the URL attribute.
ID="value"
allows the user to specify a unique ID for a table or cell. See the id attribute for more information. Note that the "value" is treated as an escString similarly to the id attribute.
POINT-SIZE="value"
sets the size of the font, in points, used within the scope of <FONT>...</FONT>. This can be overridden by a POINT-SIZE attribute in descendents. By default, the font size is determined by the fontsize attribute of the corresponding node, edge or graph.
PORT="value"
attaches a portname to the object. (See portPos.) This can be used to modify the head or tail of an edge, so that the end attaches directly to the object.
ROWS="value"
provides general formatting information concerning the rows. At present, the only legal value is "*", which causes a horizontal rule to appear between every row.
ROWSPAN="value"
specifies the number of rows spanned by the cell. The default is 1. The maximum value is 65535.
SCALE
specifies how an image will use any extra space available in its cell. Allowed values are
FALSE : keep image its natural size. (Default)
TRUE : scale image uniformly to fit.
WIDTH : expand image width to fill
HEIGHT : expand image height to fill
BOTH : expand both image width height to fill
If this attribute is undefined, the image inherits the imagescale attribute of the graph object being drawn. As with the imagescale attribute, if the cell has a fixed size and the image is too large, any offending dimension will be shrunk to fit the space, the scaling being uniform in width and height if SCALE="true". Note that the containing cell's ALIGN and VALIGN attributes override an image's SCALE attribute.
SIDES="value"
specifies which sides of a border in a cell or table should be drawn, if a border is drawn. By default, all sides are drawn. The "value" string can contain any collection of the (case-insensitive) characters 'L', 'T', 'R', or 'B', corresponding to the left, top, right and, bottom sides of the border, respectively. For example, SIDES="LB" would indicate only the left and bottom segments of the border should be drawn.
SRC="value"
specifies the image file to be displayed in the cell. Note that if the software is used as a web server, file system access to images is more restricted. See GV_FILE_PATH and SERVER_NAME.
STYLE

specifies style characteristics of the table or cell. Style characteristics are given as a comma or space separated list of style attributes. At present, the only legal attributes are "ROUNDED" and "RADIAL" for tables, and "RADIAL" for cells. If "ROUNDED" is specified, the table will have rounded corners. This probably works best if the outmost cells have no borders, or their CELLSPACING is sufficiently large. If it is desirable to have borders around the cells, use HR and VR elements, or the COLUMNS and ROWS attributes of TABLE.
The "RADIAL" attribute indicates a radial gradient fill. See the BGCOLOR and GRADIENTANGLE attributes.

TARGET="value"
determines which window of the browser is used for the URL if the object has one. See W3C documentation. Note that the "value" is treated as an escString similarly to the target attribute.
TITLE="value"
sets the tooltip annotation attached to the element. This is used only if the element has a HREF attribute. Note that the "value" is treated as an escString similarly to the tooltip attribute.
TOOLTIP="value"
is an alias for TITLE.
VALIGN

specifies vertical placement. When an object is allocated more space than required, this value determines where the extra space is placed above and below the object.
MIDDLE aligns the object in the center. (Default)
BOTTOM aligns the object on the bottom.
TOP aligns the object on the top.
WIDTH="value"
specifies the mininum width, in points, of the object. The width includes the contents, any spacing and the border. Unless FIXEDSIZE is true, the width will be expanded to allow the contents to fit. The maximum value is 65535.
There is some inheritance among the attributes. If a table specifies a CELLPADDING, CELLBORDER or BORDER value, this value is used by the table's cells unless overridden. If a cell or table specifies a BGCOLOR, this will be the background color for all of its descendents. Of course, if a background or fill color is specified for the graph object owning the label, this will be the original background for the label. The object's fontname, fontcolor and fontsize attributes are the default for drawing text. These can be overridden by using FONT to set new values. The new font values will hold until overridden by an enclosed FONT element. Finally, the pencolor or color of the graph object will be used as the border color.

If you want horizontal or vertical rules used uniformly within a table, consider using the COLUMNS or ROWS attributes rather than using many HR and VR elements.

Because of certain limitations in handling tables in a device-independent manner, when BORDER is 1 and both table and cell borders are on and CELLSPACING is less than 2, anomalies can arise in the output, such as gaps between sides of borders which should be abutting or even collinear. The user can usual get around this by increasing the border size or the spacing, or turning off the table border.
